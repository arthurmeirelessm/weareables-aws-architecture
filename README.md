This is a solution that I have designed, predominantly employing AWS serverless services. It encompasses the utilization of external wearable SDKs from renowned brands such as Apple, Huawei, and Xiaomi, which are eminent in the realm of smartwatches and wristbands. In a healthcare-oriented context, this architecture is fundamentally segmented into thirteen distinct phases, collectively shaping the comprehensive scope of its capabilities. Three of these phases concentrate on diverse output avenues, comprising APIs, dashboards, and even predictive models generated through machine learning-driven recommendations.

<br> 

* **1 - Active Wearables:** Devices or wristbands that continuously transmit patient information.

<br> 

* **2 - Data processing and shaping before being sent to AWS:** This involves extracting data from wearable devices using SDKs, libraries, or CSV files. In this solution, this step is exemplified by a mobile application, which integrates the methods for extracting data from devices and then employs the AWS SDK to transmit the data in a specified format.

<br> 

* **3 - Data Ingestion in AWS:** After the preliminary external data preprocessing, considering its architecture's capability to handle incoming data from numerous wearables simultaneously, AWS IoT Core is employed. In this context, AWS IoT Core serves as the focal point for the arrival and storage of real-time data, which is transmitted via MQTT or HTTP/HTTPS, with security ensured through x.509 certificates or KMS.
<br> 
  
* **4 - Post-Ingestion Processing and Storage:** It comprises a Lambda function triggered by an AWS IoT Core rule, thereby processing or structuring the ingested data and subsequently storing it in an AWS S3 bucket.

<br> 

* **5 - Provided Endpoint (API):** In this phase, a Lambda function is employed to extract and execute a secondary treatment, with the objective of presenting the data in a REST format.

<br> 

* **6 - API Manager Communicating with Lambda:** Step six involves utilizing the AWS API Gateway to oversee our GET endpoint, enabling the retrieval of data with specific parameters such as User ID and Wearable ID. Its security framework relies on AWS IAM, AWS Cognito, and ultimately, AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall).

<br> 

* **7 -Data Analysis:** In this step, services like AWS Glue are utilized to extract data from the S3 bucket containing wearable payloads and transform them into structured data models. Subsequently, AWS Athena is employed to execute SQL queries on data sourced directly from AWS S3 or AWS Glue, which constitutes the foundation of this architecture.
<br> 

* **8 - Dashboard:** The entity responsible for the dashboard is AWS QuickSight, which, in this scenario, can retrieve queried data from AWS Athena and convert it into dashboard insights. This process can incorporate the use of the AWS Cognito authorization and authentication mechanism to ensure restricted user access to your production URL. 

<br> 

* **9 - Machine Learning Recommendation Model:** Here lies the core of our solution. This Machine Learning model, powered by AWS SageMaker, assumes the role of constant data analysis from wearables. It's capable of detecting suspicious changes within this data, potentially identifying illnesses, risks, and patient monitoring. All of this is achieved through the analysis of various data points, including stress levels, heart rate, anomalies, sleep patterns, electrocardiograms, abnormal body temperatures, menstrual calendars, blood pressure, and more.

<br> 

* **10 - Notifier:** In this phase, AWS SNS comes into play, enabling the distribution of this data via topics and subsequently triggering AWS SQS queues. This process effectively organizes each type of recommendation based on user or wearable ID, as generated by the Machine Learning model.

<br> 

* **11 - Microservices (Queues):** Following the AWS SNS notifier, the AWS SQS queue system comes into action. It segregates these recommendation responses into distinct queues, ensuring that each Lambda can autonomously extract this information.

<br> 

* **12 - Notificar usuário:** AWS SES faz a ação de notificar usuários tanto por Email, SMS

<br> 

* **13 - Health Campaigns Section:** This section is designated for users to receive campaigns, such as health plan recommendations, alerts to schedule doctor appointments, health risk notifications, and more.
